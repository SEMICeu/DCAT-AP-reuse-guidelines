            This document provides guidance for creating new DCAT-AP profiles. It outlines a structured approach to
            identify use cases, consider appropriate solutions, build consensus, and publish profiles that extend or
            specialize the DCAT Application Profile for data portals in Europe.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            SEMIC uses <a href="https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.1/">DCAT-AP</a> as a
            master profile of DCAT, which means that all DCAT-AP profiles must comply with the
            <a href="https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.1/#provider-requirements">requirements
                and restrictions imposed by DCAT-AP</a>, namely mandatory properties and
            <a href="https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.1/#controlled-vocs">controlled
                vocabularies that must be used</a> with select properties. The process of creating a new DCAT-AP
            profile therefore starts from a minimal DCAT-AP profile, gradually extending it to cover the
            requirements driving the creation of a new profile.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the first part of this guide, we cover the process of creating a new DCAT-AP profile in 4 steps.
            In the second part, we cover the most common problematic situations in more detail and suggest
            approaches to deal with them.

        <h2>Target audience</h2>
        <p>
            This <em>how to guide</em> is intended for policy officers leading a project which is considering the
            (re)use of DCAT-AP and their team members tasked with implementing the (re)use. This Guide describes
            the high-level process to inform a policy officer on the work to be undertaken and support his decision
            making.
            For the implementers of the new DCAT-AP profile, the guide provides details on how to concretely approach
            this task while remaining compatible with the wider DCAT-AP ecosystem.

        <h2>How to create your DCAT-AP profile</h2>

        <p>
            Creating a new DCAT-AP profile is a systematic process that ensures compatibility with existing DCAT-AP
            implementations while addressing specific domain or organizational requirements. This section outlines
            the four essential steps that should be followed when developing a new profile.
        </p>

        <section>
            <h3>Step 1 - Familiarise with DCAT-AP</h3>

            <p>
                <a href="https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.1/">DCAT-AP</a> focuses on various aspects
                of dataset cataloguing such as basic dataset metadata, data services, dataset series, dataset
                versioning,
                geospatial aspects of datasets, relationships among datasets and agents, and more. These aspects are the
                ones
                collected from multiple domains and data catalogues. This does not mean that each data catalogue, and
                therefore
                each profile, needs to cover all these aspects. When creating a new DCAT-AP profile, we recommend
                starting with
                the minimal DCAT-AP compliance requirements, i.e., the mandatory classes and their mandatory properties
                for DCAT-AP,
                and therefore for every profile, identified in
                <a href="https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.1/#provider-requirements">Provider
                    requirements</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                A minimum DCAT-AP conformant catalogue contains:

            <h3 id="step-2">Step 2 - Consider your use cases and propose their resolution</h3>

            <p>
                Before extending the minimal DCAT-AP profile, the use cases targeted by the new DCAT-AP profile need to
                be described, so that approaches to their data representation can be designed.
                Examples of use cases:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>As a data publisher, I want to represent dataset distribution file format</li>
                <li>As a publisher, for an HVD dataset, I require applicable legislation to point to a specific
                    legislation IRI.</li>
                <li>As a data consumer, I want to know the language of a Data Service</li>
                <li>As a data publisher, I want to annotate Data Service with their category.</li>
                <li>As a data publisher, I want to include the HVD category in my national DCAT-AP profile</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                For each use case, its data representation can be designed according to the following standard
                situations:

                <p>
                    The part that covers the use case will be reused as-is in DCAT-AP.
                    This includes class and property labels, property cardinalities, definitions, usage notes and
                    mandatory code lists from DCAT-AP, and a link to the reused DCAT-AP class or property.

                    For example, in Czechia, every distribution needs to have a licence. This is not required by
                    DCAT-AP.
                    It is however an adjustment that tightens existing constrains. Specifically, the cardinality of
                    <a href="https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.1/#Distribution.licence">Distribution
                        licence</a>
                    in DCAT-AP is <code>0..1</code>, and in the new profile, it will be <code>1..1</code>. However, if
                    the Czech
                    legislation mandated that there need to be multiple licences attached, meaning cardinality
                    <code>1..*</code>,
                    this would not be compliant with DCAT-AP <a
                        href="https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.1/#Distribution.licence">Distribution
                        licence</a>
                    and another property would have to be used for this (in that case, <a
                        href="#use-case-not-covered-by-dcat-ap">skip to the next situations</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Generally speaking, these adjustments are possible, if they tighten existing constraints. It is not
                    possible
                    to loosen them under any conditions, as the result would no longer be compliant with DCAT-AP. For
                    example:
                </p>
                <dl>

                        As a publisher, for an HVD dataset, I require applicable legislation to point to a specific
                        legislation IRI.

                        <code>0..*</code> to <code>1..*</code>,
                        which is a compliant change. It would also be possible to make the terminology more context
                        specific,
                        e.g. rename the Dataset class to "HVD Dataset", which was not deemed necessary here.

                <p>
                    Then an original approach needs to be developed, typically supported by a new vocabulary defining
                    new classes and properties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, in Czechia, the local copyright legislation requires a finer description of a
                    <a href="https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.1/#Distribution.licence">Distribution
                        licence</a>
                    than what is supported in DCAT-AP, where these are just IRIs with the optional
                    <a href="https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.1/#LicenceDocument.type">Licence types</a>.
                    Therefore, additional new properties based on the Czech legislation needed to be defined for
                    <a href="https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.1/#LicenceDocument">Licence document</a>
                    and added to DCAT-AP-CZ.

                        As a data publisher, I want to annotate Data Service with their category.

                    Approach:

                <ul>
                    <li>Since no appropriate property was found, we create our own in our own namespace, e.g.

                    <li>Note that in this case, the property is used with a

                        that is already published as linked data, which is a prerequisite for code lists to be used with

                    When in doubt about a use case resolution, you may <a
                        href="https://github.com/SEMICeu/DCAT-AP/issues">reach out to the DCAT-AP community using
                        GitHub</a>.
                    It may be that your use case is addressed by other DCAT-AP profiles or in other contexts known by
                    the DCAT-AP community,
                    and thus that you can reuse their approach.

                <p>
                    When multiple profiles address the same use case, the DCAT-AP community may initiate a process for a
                    cross-domain
                    common DCAT-AP approach to streamline the different profile variations. For that to happen, the
                    community needs
                    to be aware of existing and emerging DCAT-AP profiles. We kindly request that newly created DCAT-AP
                    profiles
                    are announced as a <a href="https://github.com/SEMICeu/DCAT-AP/issues">DCAT-AP GitHub issue</a>.

            <h3>Step 3 - Involve relevant stakeholders to build a consensus about the new profile</h3>

            <p>
                When creating a new DCAT-AP profile, it is crucial to get all stakeholders affected by the profile to
                the
                table as early as possible in the profile development process or at least to make sure that they are
                undeniably given the opportunity to join the process. This is to avoid problems with non-acceptance of
                the
                developed profile by the stakeholders, or complaints by the stakeholders about not having the
                opportunity
                to influence the profile and therefore having problems implementing it later.
            </p>

            <p>
                Furthermore, to avoid later discussions about opinions not considered etc., the process of consensus
                building
                needs to be transparent, accessible and traceable. This can be solved by utilising a public repository
                for
                the new profile, e.g. GitHub or a public GitLab instance.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each use case from the previous step should be clearly identified e.g. as a GitHub issue. For an
                example,
                see e.g. <a href="https://github.com/SEMICeu/GeoDCAT-AP/issues/73">Issue #73 of GeoDCAT-AP</a>. Its
                description
                should contain a problem statement or requirement, and a proposed resolution, or its variants, based on
                the
                situations described in this document.
            </p>

            <p>
                The new profile community should be asked to consider the use case and express agreement or
                disagreement,
                and possibly an alternative to the proposed resolution. A consensus about the resolution of the
                individual
                use cases should be reached, giving credibility to the resolutions and the new DCAT-AP profile.
            </p>

            <p>
                If there is insufficient activity around the profile, or discussions about some use cases do not lead to
                a consensus,
                webinars with the profile community, where interested parties may discuss alternatives and vote on a
                resolution
                in a more interactive way, should be organised. For each webinar, a set of issues to be discussed should
                be
                identified and sent in advance with the invitation to that webinar. The reached resolutions then need to
                be
                recorded with the issues in the repository.
            </p>

            <p>
                An example of such a process is the GeoDCAT-AP 3.0.0 revision, documented
                <a href="https://semiceu.github.io/GeoDCAT-AP/releases/3.0.0/#meeting-minutes">in the specification</a>.

        <section>
            <h3>Step 4 - Publish the new DCAT-AP profile</h3>

            <p>
                It is important that the new DCAT-AP profile is published on the Web to avoid problems with its
                findability
                and accessibility. Artifacts of the profile such as the human readable documentation, RDFS vocabulary
                with
                definitions of new classes and properties, or SHACL shapes validating defined constraints should be
                published
                at publicly accessible URLs. As these URLs need to be as stable as possible not to break references in
                future,
                a conscious effort should be invested in their definition. See
                <a
                    href="https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/semic-support-centre/document/10-rules-persistent-uris">10
                    Rules for Persistent URIs</a>
                for inspiration. This may also include usage of Persistent URL services such as <a
                    href="https://w3id.org">w3id.org</a>. As a free web-hosting
                service, e.g. <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> can be used. The following steps

                            and contact information, e.g. a link to a GitHub repository, where feedback can be
                            collected.

                Making the profile publicly accessible serves not only the intended audience, but also the broader
                community,
                increasing cross fertilisation, i.e. avoiding situations where various profiles address similar use
                cases in
                different ways, making them less interoperable, and the overall profile ecosystem more complex.

            about
            a use case resolution, you may reach out to the DCAT-AP community using GitHub. It may be that your use case
            is addressed by other DCAT-AP profiles or in other contexts known by the DCAT-AP community, and thus that
            you

            <h3>Expectations on Linked Data, Dereferenceability and URI behaviour</h3>

            <section>
                <h4>Problem sketch</h4>
                <p>
                    DCAT-AP is a Semantic Web data specification. Despite that the specification does not enforce the
                    data
                    exchange in implementation to be in native Linked Data formats (RDF serialisations), this is
                    implicitly
                    expected by many editors or contributors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, the profile should not block the implementation as Linked Data exchange. Consult also the
                    <a href="https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.1/#identifiers">section on identifiers in

                    Not following these standards will cause systems that rely on them to not be able to process your
                    data.
                    If dereferenceability is not in place systems and users will not be able to understand new elements
                    nor
                    understand how they are to be used. Elements which are not dereferenceable in the best case are
                    disregarded
                    or in the worst case the entire dataset might be thrown out. By not meeting the expectations a new
                    barrier
                    to interoperability is created undoing the efforts made on the reuse of DCAT-AP.

                <p>
                    For a given use case, there is a property/class in DCAT-AP that seems appropriate at first glance,
                    e.g. based on its IRI or label, etc. However, upon closer examination, application of the
                    property/class
                    does not fit exactly its definition or usage note in DCAT-AP.

                    <li>
                        If the description seems formulated vaguely in DCAT-AP, and a more fitting description is
                        required,
                        that does not contradict the DCAT-AP formulations and only makes them more specific to the
                        context
                        of the new profile, then reuse is still possible.

                                If the changes are simply terminological, but otherwise it is OK to treat the
                                property/class as it is
                                defined in DCAT-AP, the more precise labels can be applied to the HTML documentation.

                                        "directives", as this label better fits their context.
                                        Other than that, the values are "The legislation that mandates the creation or
                                        management of the Dataset." as stated in the definition.
                                        It is fine if outside of the profile context, the values are labelled as
                                        "applicable legislation".</li>

                                        It is fine if both are interpreted as "applicable legislation" outside of the

                                        each must be validated separately, as the distinction is significant.</li>

                        does not fit, then the class/property cannot be reused, as it would cause confusion with DCAT-AP
                        users. A new class/property
                        needs to be defined and used.

                                because the definition says

                                legislation mentioning the dataset.
                                Therefore, the reuse of the property in this context would be confusing from DCAT-AP

                    When reusing existing classes and properties, profile authors must make sure that the labels,
                    definitions and
                    usage notes in DCAT-AP still capture the meaning of the data, even if in a more abstract way, and
                    that there
                    are no semantic differences or contradictions. This is because the users outside of the profile
                    context will
                    interpret the data using the DCAT-AP interpretation, which must not be confusing.

                <p>
                    A reused DCAT-AP property for a certain class fits a use case of the new profile. However, there is
                    a
                    <a href="https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.1/#controlled-vocs">controlled vocabulary
                        attached</a>
                    to the property for this class in DCAT-AP, and it is not fit for purpose.

                        Some items that are required in the profile are missing in the controlled

                <h4>Problem sketch</h4>
                <p>
                    An existing DCAT-AP property fits the use case of the new profile we want to address. However, a
                    different range is required.
                    For example:

                    <dt>DCAT-AP situation</dt>
                    <dd>There is a property <a
                            href="https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.1/#Dataset.spatialresolution">Dataset
                            spatial resolution</a>

                        a dataset, measured in meters."
                        and the range of <code>xsd:decimal</code>.</dd>
                    <dt>Problem</dt>
                    <dd>I want to be able to use arbitrary units of measurement, not just
                        meters. This means that the range
                        would be a class instead of a literal representing the number of meters.</dd>
                    <dt>Solution</dt>
                    <dd>A different property needs to be used, as reuse of the original
                        property in this case would not be

                <p>
                    There can be several types of range incompatibilities, and what can or cannot be done in each case
                    depends on the exact
                    nature of the incompatibility resulting from the combination of expected range types and the ones
                    defined in DCAT-AP.

                <h4>Explanation</h4>
                <p>
                    Existing DCAT-AP implementations expect value types (datatype, class instance, controlled
                    vocabulary) specified for
                    existing DCAT-AP properties. Narrowing down the value space will not create any issues but extending
                    it will.

            <h3>You want to add a new property, to which class it should be assigned?</h3>

            <section>
                <h4>Problem sketch</h4>
                <p>
                    When the use case resolution requires definition of a new property, its domain and range should be
                    defined as well.
                    If this property is to be used in multiple contexts, the question is, what should be its range.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DCAT-AP applies the guideline to use properties at their most concrete usage context. For example,
                    the
                    <a href="https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.1/#Dataset.applicablelegislation">applicable
                        legislation of a Dataset</a>
                    is used at the level of a Dataset with the definition <em>The legislation that mandates the creation or
                    management of the Dataset</em>.
                    Then, it is used <a
                        href="https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.1/#DataService.applicablelegislation">again,
                        at the level of a Data Service</a>,
                    as <em>The legislation that mandates the creation or management of the Data Service</em>, reflecting the
                    specifics of the context
                    given by the class on which it is used. However, both usages are of the same property
                    <code>r5r:applicableLegislation</code>.
                    This property is defined separately, in the <a
                        href="https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/r5r/releases/3.0.0/#applicableLegislation">DCAT-AP
                        Vocabulary</a>,
                    with the more generic definition <em>the legislation that is applicable to this resource</em> and the
                    generic domain <code>rdfs:Resource</code>.
                    This is done so that the property itself is reusable in multiple contexts. Then, its reuse can be
                    further described in the
                    specific context such as Dataset or Data Service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another example can be seen in <a href="https://github.com/SEMICeu/DCAT-AP/issues/384">DCAT-AP Issue
                        #384</a> for the property
                    spatial resolution, where one property is used in three different contexts, differently each time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The same principle is suggested for properties define in DCAT-AP profiles, i.e. a reusable
                    definition of the property in a vocabulary,
                    and then description of its context-specific usage in the profile documentation.

                <ol>
                    <li>Define the new property in a supporting vocabulary. This consists of
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Create if it does not exist yet, or otherwise use a supporting vocabulary in a managed namespace, see <a
                                    href="https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/r5r/releases/3.0.0/#applicableLegislation">DCAT-AP
                                    Vocabulary</a> for the <a
                                    href="http://data.europa.eu/r5r"><code>http://data.europa.eu/r5r</code></a>
                                namespace as an example.</li>
                            <li>Add the property to the supporting vocabulary.</li>
                            <li>Ensure the domain is as open as possible: use <code>dcat:Resource</code> for catalogable resources, or <code>rdfs:Resource</code> for generic resources</li>
                            <li>Ensure the range is as open as possible:
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>For object properties use <code>rdfs:Resource</code>, or a very generic class</li>
                                    <li>For datatype properties use <code>rdfs:Literal</code>, or <code>rdf:langString</code> (to ensure multilinguality is always supported)</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Provide the label, definition and usage note. Ensure coherency with the formal specification. Most
                                importantly replace the local class context with the corresponding generic context.
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>For example, do not write as definition: "status of the Dataset" when the domain is <code>dcat:Resource</code>. Write "status of the catalogued resource" instead.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Ensure that this supporting vocabulary is correctly published in HTML and RDF.</li>
                    <li>Apply the newly created property in the DCAT-AP profile.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h4>Explanation</h4>
                <p>
                    This application is not different from the usage of any other property already present in DCAT-AP. Use the same reuse steps as described in previous situations to document the usage as precise as possible.
                </p>

                    Considering the DCAT-AP profile and the supporting vocabulary as two distinct specifications, each with their own lifecycle, removes the design conflict (detailed usage context versus generic reusable context) profile builders experience.

                <h4>Explanation</h4>
                <p>
                    Existing DCAT-AP implementations expect values for mandatory properties and treat properties with
                    number of values
                    limited to 1 as such. Applications might implement simple values as simple attributes, not expect
                    arrays in code.
                    SPARQL queries may not aggregate over variables which are expected to have at most one value or may
                    expect values for
                    mandatory properties. These may break if the constraints are violated.

            <h3>You want to reuse a DCAT-AP class but need to change the existing usage scope or
                definitions</h3>

            <section>
                <h4>Problem sketch</h4>
                <p>
                    A new DCAT-AP profile describes the use of DCAT-AP in a new usage context. The generic DCAT-AP
                    descriptions for the
                    classes, such as Catalogue, Dataset, Distribution, ... may need to be contextualised for the profile
                    to be supportive
                    for the profile audience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> In the new profile context, the audience calls Data Interface what in DCAT-AP is called a
                    Distribution.
                    In the new profile, the class <code>dcat:Distribution</code> will therefore have the Data Interface
                    label,
                    which will be used throughout the profile document.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another related challenge may occur influencing the classes' usage notes or definitions. The
                    profile's usage
                    context applies to the whole document. It, however, may happen that the profile combines several
                    distinct usage contexts together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> I want to have a different set of mandatory properties for Distribution when it represents
                    a downloadable file,
                    and a different set of mandatory properties for Distribution when it represents a data service. Then
                    in the usage notes
                    of all properties, I need to repeat sentences like <em>If the Distribution represents a Data Service,
                    this is mandatory.
                    If the Distribution represents a downloadable file, this is not mandatory.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Without taking any measures, integrating distinct usage contexts into one class leads to more
                    complex and longer usage
                    descriptions. And, therefore, increasing the risk for misinterpretations.

                <h4>What to do</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Describe the usage context in the introductory sections of the DCAT-AP profile. A profile
                        without a well
                        circumscribed context is subject to the existential question: what does this profile address
                        differently than DCAT-AP?
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Example 1:</strong> State <em>This profile describes Datasets coming from the Zoological domain.</em> -
                                then it is clear that what
                                is written in this profile does not apply elsewhere.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example 2:</strong> See the <a

                    <li>
                        (where necessary) Improve the usage notes of the reused DCAT-AP classes to provide the readers
                        with an as much precise context as possible
                        to understand the difference between an instance for a class in DCAT-AP and an instance of the
                        corresponding class in the new DCAT-AP profile.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> There is distinction between a <a

                                and a <a href="https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.0-hvd/#Dataset">Dataset in
                                    the context of DCAT-AP HVD</a>.
                                Datasets described in DCAT-AP do not have the requirement to fulfil the HVD IR, while
                                Datasets in DCAT-AP HVD are fulfilling it.
                                See the <a href="https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.0-hvd/#scope">DCAT-AP

                        If there are multiple separate contexts of the same reused class e.g. as with the Distributions
                        example above, create a subclass
                        of the corresponding DCAT-AP class for each of the contexts. Apply the same publication rules as
                        for new properties (as in <a href="#new-property-assignment"></a>)
                        and introduce the new class in the supporting vocabulary.

                    <li>
                        If the usage contexts supersede one class, creating an additional, separate sub-profile for the
                        context is preferred,
                        containing all the affected classes and properties in that context.

                                defines a specific usage context
                                spanning Datasets, Data Services and Distributions. That is why it is a separate profile
                                (annex) of DCAT-AP.</li>

                <h4>Explanation</h4>
                <p>
                    Each profile must express its motivation to exist. That scope reflects into the usage scoping of the
                    classes.
                    When a profile combines multiple usage scopes in one document, profile editors must either
                    generalise the usage
                    scopes to fit all cases, either create subclasses or sub profiles to document the requirements for
                    each usage scope.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Reasoning example:</strong> If one would merge <a
                        href="https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.1/">DCAT-AP</a> with its annex <a
                        href="https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.0-hvd/">DCAT-AP HVD</a> into one document having one formal
                    representation of the two usage contexts (outside of HVD and within HVD) then one can either:
                </p>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Write in the usage notes of each property: <em>If this property is
                        used to describe a High Value Dataset then the following additional guidelines hold ...</em>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>If that applies to a single property in one class, then it may be acceptable.</li>
                            <li>But in this case, it would apply to many properties, exploding the size of the formal description, and
                                thus creating a burden for the reader to apply the guidelines depending on the
                                usage context correctly.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Create an HVD Dataset subclass of a DCAT-AP Dataset and associating
                        all HVD requirements solely with that subclass, the audience reading the single
                        document having interest in the HVD context will find more condensed
                        descriptions of the implementation requirements.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    However, if the usage context supersedes a single class, and
                    requires more support, then it is advised to create an additional, separate sub-profile of the
                    currently created profile, describing that usage context. This is the motivation for
                    creating the DCAT-AP HVD as annex (profile) of DCAT-AP, as there are specific
                    HVD related requirements not only for Datasets, but also for Data Services and
                    Distributions.

                    There is a use case that can be addressed by reusing an external specification to describe a related
                    resource.
                    The specification already contains extensive documentation on how to describe that resource. Should
                    this description
                    be replicated in the new profile, or is linking to it enough?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> In DCAT-AP, a standard, to which a Dataset conforms, is linked using

                    On the other hand, in GeoDCAT-AP, the class Standard
                    <a href="https://semiceu.github.io/GeoDCAT-AP/releases/3.0.0/#Standard">has specific properties from
                        Dublin Core and other vocabularies listed</a>,
                    specifying expectations that GeoDCAT-AP applications might have on Standards used in the GeoDCAT-AP
                    context.

                    The question is whether these properties should be present in GeoDCAT-AP metadata records (e.g. in a
                    catalogue)
                    for every standard linked, or whether it is expected that a repository of Standards, which may exist
                    independently
                    of the catalogue, will use these properties.

                <p>
                    An orthogonal problem is whether these expectations are influenced by the Standard having an IRI or

                    and that IRI being or not being dereferenceable.

                    Standards with non-dereferenceable IRIs or standards not identified by IRIs might have to be
                    described by the properties,
                    if they are to be identifiable.

                    Both situations also relate to how the profile owner positions the data specification to its
                    audience: as a specification
                    in the landscape of other profiles or as an implementation guideline. In the first perspective it is
                    natural to reference
                    to other specifications for the semantics and guidelines, while the implementation perspective draws
                    in decisions based
                    on the interpretation of these referenced specifications. That eases the work for implementers but
                    makes the profile
                    more dependent on an implementation perspective.

                <h4>What to do</h4>
                <p>
                    DCAT-AP profiles should be designed as much as possible from a generic profile perspective, staying
                    close to the core
                    classes of DCAT-AP. This approach is about defining the common ground for both perspectives. From
                    this core, an extension
                    towards implementation support can be made easily.
                </p>
                <p>For the following steps we assume object properties.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Set the range for the property to the most appropriate generic class.
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>
                                The referenced description of the range is sufficient, or only requires a minimum
                                implementation guidelines:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>do not add any additional formal constraint to the range.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The range needs more elaboration:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Data exchanges prefer the use of URI as values, e.g., the value of a licence is
                                        preferably a URI
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Reconsider adding additional requirements in the formal specification.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>If needed, add a separate section to handle the case when the shared
                                                value is not a URI.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Additional properties are necessary, even if the values are to be shared as a
                                        URI
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Consider the impact the property may impose on the management of
                                                instances of the range class.
                                                For instance, if one requires a title for a licence, then the profile
                                                imposes that all licences
                                                must have a title. As DCAT-AP profiles overlap, this requirement is not
                                                only for the data exchange
                                                in the context of the profile but also will impact the work in the
                                                context of other profiles,
                                                when used in combination.</li>
                                            <li>Introduce the property presence requirement in the most generic way
                                                possible, to minimize the cross-profile interference.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
